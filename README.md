## About the project

This REST API project was implemented for educational purposes at GoIT school, where we learned how to work
collaboratively in a team. We built the entire project from scratch using Java and related development environments,
including IntelliJ IDEA, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub, and more.

#### The main functions of the project:

- Generate short URLs for any valid link.
- Edit/track individual URLs.
- Ability to track statistics of following by shortened URLs.

#### Technologies used:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data
- PostgreSQL
- JWT
- FlyWay
- Swagger
- OpenApi 3.0
- Mockito
- CI pipeline (GitHub actions)
- Docker
- Docker-compose

## Project requirements

- There should be two launch profiles, default and prod https://www.baeldung.com/spring-profiles
- The default profile is set to run locally.
- Prod for the remote server (if available)
- The application must have a Dockerfile, and the local application startup (application + database) must be described
  in docker-compose.yml
- Database for tests should be run using https://java.testcontainers.org/
- All private information, such as login and password, to the database must be in the form of environment variables:
  ${DB_USERNAME}
- Environment variables must be described in the README.md file

1. Registration and authentication of users

Registration:

- Verification of the uniqueness of the username.
- Password must contain at least 8 characters, including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Storage of passwords in encrypted form.

Authentication:

- Checking the entered data for compliance with the data in the database.
- Upon successful authorization, return JWT (JSON Web Token), which will be used for further authentication.

2. Short reference

- It must contain a short link, the original one, the date of creation, the number of clicks on it and the user who
  created it.
- The link must have an expiration date.

3. Creating a short link

- Only a registered user can create a short link.
- The original link must be valid.
- The system should generate a new short link (6-8 random letters/numbers).
- Short and original link should be stored in the database according to the user.

4. User capabilities

- The user has the opportunity to view all created active links and their statistics.
- User can create new / delete existing link.

5. Follow the link

- Even a non-registered user can follow the shortened link.
- Statistics of transitions should be updated.
- The response must be cached.

## How to start the project

As it mentioned earlier, we use an environment variables in this project. So, before start the project be sure that
you have build the project, set up the environment variables and created the variables.env file with all the necessary
requirements.
`variables.env`

    # DB env
    DB_PASSWORD=password
    DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://goit.c082abjve5fs.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/quick_link
    DB_USERNAME=postgres

    # pgAdmin env
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@example.com
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: admin
    PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT: 8080

Also, in order to start the project you need to generate `docker-image`

     docker build -t quick-link .
     docker run -d -p 9999:9999 -e DB_PASSWORD='password' -e DB_URL='url' -e DB_USERNAME='username' andriiiiiko/quick-link
